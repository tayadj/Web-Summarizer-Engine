"Biology is the scientific study of life. It is a natural science with a broad scope but has several unifying themes that tie it together as a single, coherent field.","Biology is a natural science that studies life"
"Biology is the science of life. It spans multiple levels from biomolecules and cells to organisms and populations.","Biology spans from cells to populations"
"In the global ecosystem or biosphere, matter exists as different interacting compartments, which can be biotic or abiotic as well as accessible or inaccessible, depending on their forms and locations.","Matter in ecosystem can be biotic or abiotic, accessible or inaccessible"
"A biogeochemical cycle is a pathway by which specific elements of matter are turned over or moved through the biotic (biosphere) and the abiotic (lithosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere) compartments of Earth.","Biogeochemical cycle move elements of mater through the ecosystem"
"This list of life sciences comprises the branches of science that involve the scientific study of life – such as microorganisms, plants, and animals including human beings.","Life sciences study microorganisms, plants, animals, and humans."
"This science is one of the two major branches of natural science, the other being physical science, which is concerned with non-living matter.","Life sciences are one of the two main branches of natural science, alongside physical science."
"Biology is the overall natural science that studies life, with the other life sciences as its sub-disciplines.","Biology is the main natural science studying life"
"Some life sciences focus on a specific type of organism. For example, zoology is the study of animals, while botany is the study of plants.","Some life sciences focus on specific organisms"
"Other life sciences focus on aspects common to all or many life forms, such as anatomy and genetics.","Other life sciences study common aspects of life forms"
"Some focus on the micro-scale (e.g. molecular biology, biochemistry) other on larger scales (e.g. cytology, immunology, ethology, pharmacy, ecology).","Some life sciences focus on micro-scale, others on larger scales"

"Evolution is the change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations.","Evolution is the change in heritable traits of populations over generations"
"It occurs when evolutionary processes such as natural selection and genetic drift act on genetic variation, resulting in certain characteristics becoming more or less common within a population over successive generations.","Evolution occurs through natural selection and genetic drift acting on genetic variation"
"The process of evolution has given rise to biodiversity at every level of biological organisation.","Evolution has created biodiversity"
"The scientific theory of evolution by natural selection was conceived independently by two British naturalists, Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, in the mid-19th century as an explanation for why organisms are adapted to their physical and biological environments.","Darwin and Wallace independently conceived the theory of evolution by natural selection in the mid-19th century"
"The theory was first set out in detail in Darwin's book On the Origin of Species.","Darwin detailed the theory in his book On the Origin of Species."
"Evolution by natural selection is established by observable facts about living organisms: (1) more offspring are often produced than can possibly survive; (2) traits vary among individuals with respect to their morphology, physiology, and behaviour; (3) different traits confer different rates of survival and reproduction (differential fitness); and (4) traits can be passed from generation to generation (heritability of fitness).","Natural selection is based on observable facts: overproduction of offspring, trait variation, differential fitness, and heritability"
"In successive generations, members of a population are therefore more likely to be replaced by the offspring of parents with favourable characteristics for that environment.","Favorable traits increase in frequency over generations."
"In the early 20th century, competing ideas of evolution were refuted and evolution was combined with Mendelian inheritance and population genetics to give rise to modern evolutionary theory.","Early 20th-century synthesis of evolution with Mendelian genetics formed modern evolutionary theory."
"In this synthesis the basis for heredity is in DNA molecules that pass information from generation to generation.","DNA is the basis for heredity in modern evolutionary theory."
"The processes that change DNA in a population include natural selection, genetic drift, mutation, and gene flow.","DNA changes in populations through natural selection, genetic drift, mutation, and gene flow."
"All life on Earth—including humanity—shares a last universal common ancestor (LUCA), which lived approximately 3.5–3.8 billion years ago.","All life shares a last universal common ancestor (LUCA) from 3.5–3.8 billion years ago."
"The fossil record includes a progression from early biogenic graphite to microbial mat fossils to fossilised multicellular organisms.","The fossil record shows a progression from early biogenic graphite to multicellular fossils."
"Existing patterns of biodiversity have been shaped by repeated formations of new species (speciation), changes within species (anagenesis), and loss of species (extinction) throughout the evolutionary history of life on Earth.","Biodiversity patterns are shaped by speciation, anagenesis, and extinction."
"Morphological and biochemical traits tend to be more similar among species that share a more recent common ancestor, which historically was used to reconstruct phylogenetic trees, although direct comparison of genetic sequences is a more common method today.","Similar traits among species with recent common ancestors help reconstruct phylogenetic trees."
"Evolutionary biologists have continued to study various aspects of evolution by forming and testing hypotheses as well as constructing theories based on evidence from the field or laboratory and on data generated by the methods of mathematical and theoretical biology.","Evolutionary biologists study evolution through hypotheses, theories, and evidence from various methods."
"Their discoveries have influenced not just the development of biology but also other fields including agriculture, medicine, and computer science.","Discoveries in evolution have influenced biology, agriculture, medicine, and computer science."
